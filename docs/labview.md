## Linux LabVIEW Instructions

To access labview, go to root folder:

    cd $home
    
Then, locate to the following folder:

    cd /usr/local/natinst/LABVIEW-20XX-XX

Then, enter the following command ( *you can omit  `sudo` on the next command - only add it if root privileges are required.*)

    sudo ./labviewprofull

LabVIEW should open at this point and you can access your VIs and make edits as necessary.
