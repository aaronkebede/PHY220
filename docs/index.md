# Welcome!


This website contains a suite of codes written to create experiments and analyze data for the **Physics 220** Class. As the semester progresses, I will be sharing the list of codes we used to analyze different types of circuits. All data and codes are available on [Github](https://github.com/aaronkebede/PHY220)



# Prerequisites
I worked on a linux envirnoment for the most part, so here are the guides to install the required programs on a linux machine. 

1.  Download and Install LabVIEW [\[Guide\]](https://www.ni.com/en-us/support/downloads/software-products/download.labview.html#411240). To locally access LabVIEW on a Linux Machine, follow  [this guide.](https://220.kebede.org/labview)
2. We run analyses on Python. We recommend installing python from Anaconda [distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).
3.  To view the required dependencies for running the data analysis, vist  [environment.yml](https://github.com/aaronkebede/PHY220/blob/main/environment.yml)
4.  We run analyses on JupyterLab, so, install Jupyter as well.  [[Installation Guide]](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/quickstart.html)

# Questions?
If you have questions or want to make suggestions, the most ideal way would be to [create an issue](https://github.com/aaronkebede/PHY220/issues/new/choose) or [a pull request](https://github.com/aaronkebede/PHY220/compare) on Github. You can also email me at aaron.kebede@lehigh.edu with questions.
